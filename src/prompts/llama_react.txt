EXAMPLE:
Question: What is the highest consumption for customer 1 on 2026-01-01?
Thought: I need to find the max consumption for customer 1 on that date. pandas_aggregator can do this.
Action: pandas_aggregator
Action Input: {"query": "SELECT consumption_kwh FROM readings WHERE customer_id = 1 AND timestamp::date = '2026-01-01'", "operation": "max", "column": "consumption_kwh", "group_by": null}
Observation: {"operation": "max", "column": "consumption_kwh", "result": 2.15}
Thought: The maximum consumption was 2.15 kWh.
Answer: The highest consumption for customer 1 on 2026-01-01 was 2.15 kWh.
